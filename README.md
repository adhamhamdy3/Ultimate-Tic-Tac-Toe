# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is an advanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It introduces an exciting twist by combining **nine smaller Tic-Tac-Toe grids** into one large board. Each move you make determines where your opponent plays next, adding layers of strategy and challenge.

### How to Play
1. The game board consists of **9 smaller grids** (3x3 layout).
2. Each smaller grid functions as a classic Tic-Tac-Toe board.
3. **First Move**: The first player can place their symbol (X or O) in any cell of any smaller grid.
4. **Subsequent Moves**:
   - The grid where you place your move determines the grid your opponent must play in next.
   - For example: If you place your move in the top-right cell of a smaller grid, your opponent must play in the **top-right smaller grid**.
5. **Winning a Grid**: A player wins a smaller grid by completing 3 consecutive symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
6. **Winning the Game**: The player who wins 3 smaller grids in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the entire game.

**If a grid is already won or full, your opponent can play in any available grid.**
